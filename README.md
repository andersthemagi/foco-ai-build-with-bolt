# Fort Collins AI - Build with Bolt Today! 

Resources from the [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) Build with Bolt workshop for Fort Collins AI. We attempted to build an application with Bolt.new in partnership for their Build with Bolt Program. 

You can access the `theprompt.md` file to see the exact prompt I used to get as close to one-shot as possible! A link to the final product will be shared once that's live. 

Thank you to [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new) for the support in 500M tokens for Fort Collins AI!
